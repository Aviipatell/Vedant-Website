        <h2><span class="accent">30 Days. 30 Teams. 30 Posters</span> — Designing a poster everyday for a month</h2>

        <p class="intro">In December 2019, I challenged myself to make 30 basketball posters (one for each team) in 30
            days. This was
            to help improve my graphic design skills.</p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Context</h3>

            <p>I’ve grown up watching basketball, and it has a pretty big thing in my life. Near the end of the 2019, I
                wanted to improve my visual design skills or just sports graphics skills in general so I decided to work
                on
                a poster everyday, one for each NBA team. </p>

            <p>I tried to make sure that all the posters looked cohesive and was presented like a series. 30 days might
                not
                seem like too long compared to other 100 day or yearly challenges but in these 30 days, I was able to
                learn
                way more about sports graphics and improve my photoshop skills then I did over the past year.</p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Starting with shapes</h3>

            <p>To start off the series, I was going for a very simple and abstract look so I decided to play with shapes
                for
                the posters. I would try and incorporate different shapes of different colours to create dept and make
                them
                more vibrant. Although shapes were “easy” to work with, I learned that adding way too many, even if they
                are
                small, would ruin the poster. I had to really think about where I place each asset to make sure it does
                not
                throw the poster off. These were some of my favourites: </p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Adding pictures</h3>

            <p>I didn’t want to just keep working with shapes alone, at one point it was difficult to come up with
                different
                ideas so I decided to bring in images for some posters. Images related to either the player or team and
                made
                the design around that. </p>

            <img src="" alt="" class="singleImg">

            <h3 class="subHead">Mixing it up</h3>

            <p>I worked with shapes only posters, and I tried out images only posters, so now I wanted to tried mixing
                both
                of them! This became a bit more challenging because sometimes the graphics would be so detailed, it’d be
                pointless to add shapes, so in order to make both of them work together, I would try to clip the graphic
                into the shape to help make it more cohesive. </p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Bad days</h3>

            <p>Doing these posters everyday, there were going to be some that wouldn’t reach my standards. These were
                during
                the experimental or early stages of trying out what works best for these posters. The problem was that
                they
                either become so busy it’s difficult to look at, but sometimes they are so simple that it looks empty.
                These
                were some of them:</p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Good days</h3>

            <p>Bad days always come with good days, and I definetely had some of them during these poster series. They
                allowed me to learn some new tools and photoshop and also experiment with some new styles. These were
                some
                of my favourites from those 30 days:</p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Reflection & Next Steps</h3>

            <p>This 30 day challenge was probably one of the best things I decided to, not only for my design career but
                also because of how much enjoyable it was to design these posters.</p>

            <p>I definetely learned a lot from these posters, and one of them being that it’s okay to take a day break
                if
                you’re struggling to come up with something. At times, I would have no idea at all for a poster and
                would
                just stare at an empty canvas for hours. This was definetely the right way, and I learned that I
                should’ve
                just take a break and looked at it the next day to refresh my head.</p>

            <p>Despite the challenge being mentally exhausting at times, it definetely is a way to keep me motivating,
                spending over 3-5 hours on each poster, stopping was definetely not an option. My photoshop skills have
                improved, and my vision for sports graphics has also improved immensely and I hope to use the skills I
                learned in this challenge in other projects I do. </p>
