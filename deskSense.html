        <p class="intro">DeskSense is an iOS health app designed to target professionals or students working at a desk
            for long
            periods of time to help with their physical and mental health.</p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Problem</h3>

            <p>Designers have a passion problem. Many of us are workaholics and are constantly working at a desk or are
                interacting with our devices for long periods of time.</p>

            <p>This constant interaction spirals into many health problems, mental and physical. Often these problems
                get
                overlooked, and are set aside because we are so immersed into our work. As a creative, I have
                experienced
                these issues and believe it is essential for us to take care of ourselves and work towards a solution.
                With
                the apps out right now, many are not targetted specifically for creatives, or people working at a desk.
                Many
                are also either focused on physical activity or mental activity based. This results in multiple apps
                being
                downloaded in order to meet the users needs.</p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Research</h3>

            <p>To further understand what health issues creatives face, I conducted a survey among other creatives.
                Although
                the questions might seem simple, they helped me gain a clear scope of the problem:</p>

            <p class="indent1"> — What are some common health issues that you face as a creative?</p>

            <p class="indent1">The first question was constructed to get the respondent to start thinking about certain
                health issues they
                faced. With the responses I received, I decided to split these health issues into two: Mental and
                Physical.
            </p>

            <section class="twoBulletLayout">

                <section id="mentalResearch">
                    <p>Mental</p>

                        <li>Stress</li>
                        <li>Mental Exhaustion</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Back Pain</li>
                        <li>Dehydration / Malnourishment</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

            </section>

            <p class="indent1">— What are some things that you would like to do to improve your health? </p>

            <p class="indent1">— If you believe you have a healthy lifestyle, what are some things you do that allow you
                to
                have this kind of lifestyle?</p>

            <p class="indent1">After the respondents finish up answering the health issues they face, they are asked
                about
                what they wish to do or are doing to improve these issues. These were the most common responses:</p>

            <ul class="indent2">
                <li>To eat healthier</li>
                <li>To exercising at least once a day, even if it's a light workout</li>
                <li>Staying hydrated</li>
                <li>Dehydration / Malnourishment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subHead">Goal</h3>

            <p>To help creatives improve their mental and physical health by providing different activities and
                reminders
                specifically meant for creatives all in one app.</p>

            <p>KPI: Total reminders set for the user, number of activities saved and tried out.</p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Competitive Analysis</h3>

            <p>In order to get an understanding of other mobile health apps, I did a competitve analysis on a couple
                that
                stood out to me. These were two of the popular ones on the app store and similar to many others I found.

                    <p>My initial plan for the app was to just make it one screen for user convenience. I thought that
                        having less screens would make it less confusing but when I looked into it, I was definetely
                        wrong.
                    </p>

                    <p>Although the one screen is simple, the user would have to keep clicking through each section
                        going
                        deeper into each category eventually making it harder to come to the original screen. </p>

            <h5 class="subHead2">Storyboard</h5>

            <p>After the initial thought I had for the app, I knew I had to make more wireframes and create a storyboard
                in order to make sure the users experience with the app was as simple as possible. </p>

            <p>I decided to have four screens, the first one starting with the home screen which gives the user the
                ability to view their reminders for the day. The next screen is for mental activities where the user has
                access to various exercises that they can select. Same goes for the other two screens, one for physical
                activites and the other for tips. </p>

            <p>Changes made from version 2:</p>

            <ul class="finalUpdates">
                <li>Reminders were moved up in the screen because they're more of a priority</li>
                <li>Recent and saved activities tabs were added for convenience for the user</li>
                <li>Shapes were removed and activities are easier to view</li>
                <li>Bottom toolbar is changed to a snapchat inspired toolbar (with left and right swipe)</li>
                <li class="indentLi">There reason for this was to make sure the user doesn't have to learn anything new
                    for the
                    app
                    and can adapt to it easily
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subHead">Reflection & Next Steps</h3>

            <p>Working on the DeskSense app has definitely been an effective learning exeprience for me. It allowed me
                to
                understand the importantance of storyboarding and putting myself in the users shoes.</p>

            <p>At first, the amount of activities and health issues were overwhelming and I was confused on how I would
                organize everything but with the help of wireframing and user testing, I was able to break everything
                down,
                take out the unnecessary features and only keep the most important ones.</p>

            <p>Although the first design process for the app is complete, there is still a lot more work to be done for
                the
                second version. My next steps would be to get users to test out the figma prototype and get feedback on
                how
                they like the app. I would also like the add a way to monetize the app, and how it can be able to gain
                passive income. For now, there is only an iOS version, which is why I would need to modify the app to
                work
                with other phones just as smootly because not everyone has an iphone. My final step would be to add more
                features that would cater the app towards designers.</p>

            <p>This app has allowed me to realize to slow down my process and knowing that it’s not always about visuals
                and
                it’s important to think about how the user will interact with the app.</p>
