        <h2><span class="accent">West Humber C.I.</span> — Redesigning their brand and website</h2>

        <p class="intro">West Humber Collegiate Institute (WHCI) is a public high school in Toronto, Ontario. I
            graduated from
            highschool in June 2019 so I decided to rebrand them to solve some issues they were having.</p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Branding Problem</h3>

            <p>Versatility is an on going issue with their current logo. One of the main conflicts was that the logo
                dosen’t
                work well with the school athletics department as it lacks the boldness and sharpness that sports logos
                have, causing some teams to create their own version, weakening the brand identity as a whole.</p>

            <h3 class="subHead">Moodboard</h3>

            <p>The first step in the logo design process, I started researching on what elements did I want the logo to
                have.</p>

            <img src="images/g1.png" alt="" class="singleImg" id = "moodBoard">

            <h5 id = "mainLogoSub" class="subHead2">The Main Logo</h5>

            <p id = "mainLogoPara">The first concept is focused on being the primary school logo that will be used for proffessional
                documents,
                graphics for school events, business cars, uniform, etc. The idea was to have the logo in a school crest
                style, with the focus of making it as appealing as possible by using minimalism and modernism for a bold
                look.</p>

            <h5 id = "athleticsLogo" class="subHead2">WHCI Athletics Logo</h5>
 
            <img src="images/g4.png" class="singleImg" alt="" id = "athleticsBranding">

            <h3 id = "moreHead" class="subHead">There's more!</h3>

            <p id = "moreHeadPara">Along with the brand redesign, I decided to also recreate the school’s website. Although, the website
                redesign does not follow the certain rules and restrictions the school board has for their websites, it
                is a
                much more modern approach to the current website they have. With the boards restrictions, it is
                difficult to
                come up with something appealing.</p>

            <h3 id = "problemHead" class="subHead">Problem</h3>

            <p class = "problemPara">The problem with their current website was that all their information was crammed resulting in the user
                to
                get confused due to the lack of organization. Which is why I decided to go for a simple approach by
                condensing the information to make sure everything fits on one page having all the neccessary
                information
                that a regular school website would have.</p>

            <p class = "problemPara">With the help of user testing and conducting many surveys, the main things I found out from the students
                is
                that they never look at the website, it’s ugly, and that it’s useless. This is how I fixed it.</p>

            <h3 class="subHead bringUp">Reflection & Next Steps</h3>

            <p class = "bringUp">Studying at West Humber C.I. and graduating from there allowed me to really understand them as a school,
                and
                what are it’s values and beliefs. Although this rebranding was not official, and was just for fun, it
                allowed me to dive deeper into branding and also expand my product design skills. </p>

            <p class = "bringUp">Some key takeaways from this project from the branding side was to make sure the logo resonates with the
                school itself. It was difficult at first to make something better than their exisiting logo but it
                allowed
                me to realize the importance of moodboards and the logo design process in order to work towards
                something
                better.</p>

            <p class = "bringUp">This was also one of my first product design projects and despite me not giving a deeper analysis on the
                process of the website creation, I was able to learn a few new methods in order to ensure that the
                user’s
                needs are met.</p>

            <h5 class="subHead2 bringUp">Feedback</h5>

            <p class = "bringUp">I decided to present my rebranding to the school and explain my reasoning for the rebrand. Unfortunately,
                it
                was decided not to use the logo for a few reasons; one being it could be mistaken as a bull when it was
                made
                originally as the letter V with a helment.</p>

            <p class = "bringUp">The next steps for the logo would be to restart the logo process and think about what can make it stand
                out
                from other schools but also relate to a viking. I want to also work on the website more and try to
                create
                something that could match the board’s requirements.</p>
